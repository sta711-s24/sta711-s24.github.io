## Agenda

* Introductions
* Overview of course details
* Begin logistic regression
* HW1 released on course website


## Class overview

* STA 711 focuses on *statistical inference*: estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing
* Throughout the semester, topics will be initially motivated by logistic regression
* We will continue with inference and GLMs in STA 712 (Generalized Linear Models)


## Grading philosophy

* Focusing on grades can detract from the learning process
* Homework should be an opportunity to *practice* the material. It is ok to make mistakes when practicing, as long as you make an honest effort
* Errors are a good opportunity to learn and revise your work
* Partial credit and weighted averages of scores make the meaning of a grade confusing. Does an 85 in the course mean you know 85% of everything, or everything about 85% of the material?


## Grading in this course

* I will give you feedback on every assignment
* All assignments are graded as Mastered / Not yet mastered
* If you haven't yet mastered something, you get to try again!


## Course components

* Regular homework assignments
  * Practice material from class
  * You may resubmit "Not yet mastered" questions once
* 3 take-home exams
  * Opportunity to demonstrate mastery of course material
  * Optional make-up exams for "Not yet mastered" questions
* Optional final exam
  * Final opportunity to demonstrate mastery


## Assigning grades

To get an **A-** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-2* homework assignments
* Master at least 80% of the questions on all three exams

To get an **A** in the course:

* Receive credit for at least *N-1* homework assignments
* Master at least 80% of the questions on all three exams


## Late work and resubmissions

* You get a bank of **5** extension days. You can use 1--2 days on any assignment, exam, or project.
* No other late work will be accepted (except in extenuating circumstances!)


## Motivating example: Dengue fever

**Dengue fever:** a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting 400 million people a year

## Motivating example: Dengue data

**Data:** Data on 5720 Vietnamese children, admitted to the hospital with possible dengue fever. Variables include:

* *Sex*: patient's sex (female or male)
* *Age*: patient's age (in years)
* *WBC*: white blood cell count
* *PLT*: platelet count
* other diagnostic variables...
* *Dengue*: whether the patient has dengue (0 = no, 1 = yes)


## Motivating example: Dengue data

**Research questions:**

* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between WBC and dengue?


## Research questions

* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between WBC and dengue?

How can I answer each of these questions? Discuss with a neighbor for 2 minutes, then we will discuss as a class.

## Fitting a model: initial attempt

What if we try a linear regression model?

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$$

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i + \varepsilon_i \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$

What are some potential issues with this linear regression model?


## Second attempt

Let's rewrite the linear regression model:


## Second attempt

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i) \hspace{1cm} p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$$

$$p_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

Are there still any potential issues with this approach?

## Don't fit linear regression with a binary response

```{r setup, echo=F, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
dengue <- read.csv("https://sta279-s22.github.io/labs/dengue.csv")

dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = WBC, y = Dengue)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, lwd=1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```


## Fixing the issue: logistic regression

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$g(p_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

where $g: (0, 1) \to \mathbb{R}$ is unbounded.

**Usual choice:** $g(p_i) = \log \left( \dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right)$


## Odds

**Definition:** If $p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$, the **odds** are $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$

**Example:** Suppose that $\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i) = 0.8$. What are the *odds* that the patient has dengue?


## Odds

**Definition:** If $p_i = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | WBC_i)$, the **odds** are $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$

The probabilities $p_i \in [0, 1]$. The linear function $\beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i \in (-\infty, \infty)$. What range of values can $\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$ take?

## Log odds

$$g(p_i) = \log \left(\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right)$$

## Binary logistic regression

$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$\log \left(\dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 WBC_i$$

**Note:** Can generalize to $Y_i \sim Binomial(m_i, p_i)$, but we won't do that yet.

## Example: simple logistic regression

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status (0 = no, 1 = yes)} \hspace{1cm} Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i)$$

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\widehat{p}_i}{1 - \widehat{p}_i}\right) = 1.737 - 0.361 \ WBC_i$$

Work in groups of 2-3 for 5 minutes on the following questions:

* Are patients with a higher WBC more or less likely to have dengue?
* Interpret the estimated slope in context of a unit change in the log odds.
* What is the change in *odds* asociated with a unit increase in WBC?
