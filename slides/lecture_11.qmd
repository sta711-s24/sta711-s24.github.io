## What we need to do

## Markov's inequality

**Theorem:** Let $Y$ be a non-negative random variable, and suppose that $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ exists. Then for any $t > 0$, 

$$P(Y \geq t) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y]}{t}$$

## Chebyshev's inequality

**Theorem:** Let $Y$ be a random variable, and let $\mu = \mathbb{E}[Y]$ and $\sigma^2 = Var(Y)$. Then

$$P(|Y - \mu| \geq t) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{t^2}$$

With your neighbor, apply Markov's inequality to prove Chebyshev's inequality.

## Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

**Theorem:** For any two random variables $X$ and $Y$,
$$|\mathbb{E}[XY]| \leq \mathbb{E}|XY| \leq (\mathbb{E}[X^2])^{1/2}(\mathbb{E}[Y^2])^{1/2}$$

**Example:** The *correlation* between $X$ and $Y$ is defined by

$$\rho(X, Y) = \dfrac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)} \sqrt{Var(Y)}}$$

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can show that $-1 \leq \rho(X, Y) \leq 1$.
