## What we need to do

## Markov's inequality

**Theorem:** Let $Y$ be a non-negative random variable, and suppose that $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ exists. Then for any $t > 0$, 

$$P(Y \geq t) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y]}{t}$$

## Chebyshev's inequality

**Theorem:** Let $Y$ be a random variable, and let $\mu = \mathbb{E}[Y]$ and $\sigma^2 = Var(Y)$.
